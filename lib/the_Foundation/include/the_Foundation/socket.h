/** @file the_Foundation/socket.h  TCP socket.

Socket is a bidirectional non-random-access Stream where data gets written by a
background I/O thread.

Every time something gets written to the Socket's output buffer, the I/O thread is woken
up and the pending data is sent. You may wish to use another Buffer to queue up data to
send in larger chunks.

Socket is derived from Stream, so all Stream methods can be used on it for writing and
reading data. Both reading and writing is non-blocking. When writing, a copy of the data
is made into an internal buffer for the I/O thread. When reading, only data already
received and waiting in the input buffer will be returned. To wait for incoming data you
can join the `readyRead` audience.
