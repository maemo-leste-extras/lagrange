    <summary>A Beautiful Gemini Client</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            Lagrange is a desktop GUI client for browsing Geminispace. 
            It offers modern conveniences familiar from web browsers, 
            such as smooth scrolling, inline image viewing, multiple 
            tabs, visual themes, Unicode fonts, bookmarks, history, and
            page outlines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like the Gemini protocol, Lagrange has been designed with
            minimalism in mind. It depends on a small number of essential
            libraries. It is written in C and uses SDL for 
            hardware-accelerated graphics. OpenSSL is used for secure
            communications.

        <release version="1.11.1" date="2022-03-02">
            <description>
                <p>Changes in v1.11:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple windows. Windows can be opened via the menu, Ctrl/⌘+N, or link context menus.</li>
                    <li>Restoring tabs at launch is now optional. Added a toggle in Preferences > General.</li>
                    <li>Site-specific settings (Shift+Ctrl/⌘+Comma), with options for theme customization and showing ANSI escape warnings. The custom theme is based on a "seed string" chosen by the user.</li>
                    <li>Fontpack search. Fonts in the skyjake.fi font library have been indexed based on all the glyphs they provide, so one can look up which fontpacks provide any missing glyphs.</li>
                    <li>"Manage Fonts" button on the Preferences > Fonts tab. It opens "about:fonts".</li>
                    <li>"Tab width" setting (default: 8). This controls how TAB characters are displayed on pages.</li>
                    <li>Setting for maximum valid URI length on 'text/gemini' link lines.</li>
                    <li>Option to show images decoded from data URLs immediately after loading a page. This is limited to JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF (no animations).</li>
                    <li>"Paste and Go" in the input field context menu.</li>
                    <li>TLS session caching: reduces the need for redundant handshaking by keeping old TLS sessions cached for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>UI language for Italian.</li>
                    <li>The input prompt dialog saves entered text persistently, just like the Upload dialog. This prevents losing text if the dialog is closed accidentally.</li>
                    <li>Input field backup is done per window, e.g., "uploadbackup.2.txt".</li>
                    <li>Sidebar context menus have more consistent "open" menu items, now including opening the item in a new window.</li>
                    <li>The missing glyphs warning dialog now shows a list of the missing code points.</li>
                    <li>Downloading the Classic Set fontpack is no longer suggested since fontpacks can be searched as needed.</li>
                    <li>Abbreviate font pack descriptions on "about:fonts". The full description is shown when viewing a single fontpack.</li>
                    <li>The active tab button uses the theme background color if the page color theme has a bright colorful background to avoid clashing with the UI accent color.</li>
                    <li>Adjusted colors of the Gray and Black page themes.</li>
                    <li>Added additional (small) variations to theme hues.</li>
                    <li>Data URLs have their own link icon.</li>
                    <li>Adjusted appearance of context menus.</li>
                    <li>Updated UI translations.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect behavior and UI glitches related to data URLs. The UI will now omit the encoded part of data URLs.</li>
                    <li>Occasional mismatch between page and banner backgrounds. It was due to loss of precision when converting colors to 8-bit RGB.</li>
                    <li>Issues with changing UI metrics when a window moves between displays. Not all UI elements were rescaled properly.</li>
                    <li>Glitches with opening and closing context menus.</li>
                    <li>TAB characters are no longer forcibly normalized to spaces.</li>
                    <li>Pasting LF characters in the URL field should not be possible.</li>
                    <li>Avoid reinitializing fonts more than once during startup.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The full release notes can be viewed inside the app by opening
                    the "about:version" page.</p>

                    <li>The "Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows" Unicode block (U+2B00...U+2BFF) is accepted as custom link icons.</li>
                    <li>When mixing Emoji into preformatted text (glyphs are from different fonts), lay out the Emoji as double-wide characters to avoid overlapping.</li>
                    <li>Faster hover-scrolling of long popup menus.</li>
                    <li>Fixed sidebars not getting updated after identity addition/deletion.</li>

                    <li>Fixed animation issue with sidebars in the right side of split view.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a refresh issue that caused the first line of the page to be redrawn continuously, spiking CPU usage.</li>
                    <li>Fixed link numbers showing up next to image captions.</li>

                    <li>Fixed possible crash when there are ANSI escapes in the alt text of a preformatted block.</li>

        <release version="1.10.3" date="2022-01-30">
            <description>
                <p>Changes in v1.10.3:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unix: Added a lagrange(1) manual page.</li>
                    <li>Hide the [+] button on the tab button row if the navbar has a New Tab button.</li>
                    <li>"/index.gmi" is considered equal to "/" when navigating to parent directory.</li>
                    <li>Site icon ❑ replaced with ⌘ ("place of interest") for a more distinct appearance and to avoid similarity with the ❐ "Open in New Tab" icon.</li>
                    <li>Navigating to parent or root from "about:" pages goes to "about:about" to see overview of all the About pages.</li>
                    <li>Gopher: Fixed navigating to root, e.g., when clicking on the page top banner. Set item type to 1 to show a gophermap and not the plain source.</li>
                    <li>Titan: When navigating to parent/root, switch URL scheme to "gemini". This action occurs on a Titan response page, so initiating a new upload with the parent/root URL is probably not appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Fixed crash when a media player is active and a new download is started.</li>
                    <li>Fixed crash when a line contains nothing but an ANSI escape sequence.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a possible crash when saving state of subscribed feeds.</li>
                    <li>Fixed the right-hand sidebar handling the U and Shift+U key events if it was showing the Feeds tab, even though the sidebar was hidden.</li>
                    <li>Fixed line wrapping at backslashes. They are now considered word-breaking characters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The full release notes can be viewed inside the app by opening
                    the "about:version" page.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed cancelling an input query. Now pressing Cancel will navigate back to the previous page as intended.</li>
                    <li>Gopher: Fixed navigating to parent. Set item type to 1 to show a gophermap and not the plain source.</li>
                    <li>Updated Smol Emoji: added the rest of Unicode 8 Emoji glyphs.</li>

            <description>
                <p>Changes in v1.10.1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed bottom actions of the Feeds sidebar getting hidden when all entries are read. This prevented switching between Unread/All filter modes.</li>
                    <li>Fixed potential crash when downloading a large file (e.g., a fontpack).</li>
                    <li>SDL event handling workaround adjusted to only apply to 2.0.18+.</li>
                    <li>Updated UI translations.</li>

        <release version="1.10" date="2022-01-17">
            <description>
                <p>Changes in v1.10:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customizable navbar actions. Right-click on a button to change its action. (Identity and hamburger buttons cannot be changed.)</li>
                    <li>Identity toolbar menu can be used to switch between alternate identities. If you have used multiple identities on one site, this makes it more convenient to switch between them.</li>
                    <li>Added "Edit Page with Titan": opens the upload dialog with current page's content prefilled.</li>
                    <li>Added "Paste Preceding Line" in the input prompt dialog. Potential use cases include user-editable sections on a page and suggested/example input values.</li>
                    <li>Added footer action to open file in another app when the media type is unsupported.</li>
                    <li>Added option to disable cursor blinking in input fields.</li>
                    <li>Added ANSI SGR codes for light and regular font weights (2, 10).</li>
                    <li>Improved image inlining: all responses with an image media type can get inlined, regardless of the file extension in the URL.</li>
                    <li>Inline image metadata goes under the image instead of possibly overlapping the label text.</li>
                    <li>Inline downloads have a context menu for relevant actions, and clicking on the download opens the file.</li>
                    <li>Improved highlighting of open pages. The highlight no longer goes under the side elements on the page.</li>
                    <li>Entry dates in feed links are de-emphasized for improved readability.</li>
                    <li>Revised link hover popup. None of the information appears on the same line any more (which was problematic if there wasn't enough space). Instead, everything is shown in a popup at the bottom/top of the view, including the identity that will be used when opening the link and the date of last visit.</li>
                    <li>Revised layout of the Upload dialog. There is a new edit field that lets you modify the file path of the URL. Identity names are in bold.</li>
                    <li>Optimized UI layout procedure and memory use during UI event processing.</li>
                    <li>Audio subsystem is only initialized when actually needed.</li>
                    <li>Prevent state file corruption if the app happens to get killed while state is being saved.</li>
                    <li>Gempub: Open books in 1:2 split mode instead of 1:1.</li>
                    <li>Minor improvements in page caching.</li>
                    <li>Detect when text is Bengali, Devanagari, Oriya, or Tamil.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a history caching issue: if there were multiple instances of the same URL in history, only the latest one's content would be used when navigating back/forward.</li>
                    <li>Fixed handling of reserved characters in URLs (cf. RFC 3986, section 2.2).</li>
                    <li>Fixed the copy/paste context menu not showing in input fields.</li>
                    <li>Fixed duplicated warnings showing in the page banner.</li>
                    <li>Fixed very narrow input fields causing the app to hang.</li>
                    <li>Fixed initial scroll position in multiline input fields.</li>
                    <li>Fixed layout issues in the sidebar on empty Feeds and Identities tabs.</li>
                    <li>Fixed lookup results list becoming too narrow.</li>
                    <li>Fixed glitches when a widget has multiple simultanous animations.</li>
                    <li>Fixed mixed-language CJK word wrapping.</li>
                    <li>Fixed parsing Atom feed dates with leading whitespace.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Changes in v1.9.1:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added "24-Hour Time" preference. Currently it only affects the page
                        timestamp in the bottom left corner.</li>
                    <li>Heading level 3 is indented like regular text lines, making the
                        difference to level 2 evident.</li>
                    <li>Fixed crash when creating a top-level bookmark.</li>
                    <li>Fixed drawing the page timestamp.</li>
                    <li>Fixed layout of tab buttons and other resizing widgets so all
                        available space is used.</li>
                    <li>Fixed tab close buttons preventing activation of very short tab
                        buttons. The close buttons only appear if there is room for
                        them.</li>
                    <li>Fixed very short tab labels not getting truncated.</li>
                    <li>Fixed the New Tab button not staying at the right edge of the
                        window, depending on how many tabs are open.</li>
                </ul>

            <description>
                <p>Changes in v1.9:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added a toolbar button for toggling the left sidebar.</li>
                    <li>Added an unsplit button in the toolbar when in split view mode.</li>
                    <li>Choose parent folder when creating or editing a bookmark.</li>
                    <li>Support for 24-bit RGB ANSI color sequences.</li>
                    <li>Support for ANSI background color escapes (disabled by default).</li>
                    <li>UI language for Turkish.</li>
                    <li>Adjusted font styles of heading levels 2 and 3.</li>
                    <li>Sidebar context menus also appear when clicking over the sidebar
                        background. In this case the menu contains general functions not
                        related to any item.</li>
                    <li>Feeds tab in the sidebar has a redesigned action toolbar with "Mark
                        All as Read", and dropdown menu and keyboard shortcuts for changing
                        the filter mode.</li>
                    <li>Feeds tab remembers the unread/all filter mode persistently.</li>
                    <li>ANSI foreground colors are modified to match colored theme
                        backgrounds (e.g., Sepia).</li>
                    <li>Navigating back and forward in history will skip input query prompts
                        (status 1x), showing only the query results.</li>
                    <li>Ctrl+A now selects all text in input fields (except on macOS, where
                        it remains the Emacs-style jump to start/end of line).</li>
                    <li>The resource bundle (resources.lgr) is now a regular ZIP archive.
                        This allows it to do double duty as a fontpack containing the
                        built-in fonts. The archive contains a version number to avoid use
                        of obsolete resources.</li>
                    <li>Fixed layout issues related to footer action buttons. Sometimes the
                        buttons would overlap page content.</li>
                    <li>Fixed handling duplicate feed entries: if multiple entries in 
                        a feed have the same URL, only use the first one.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Titan upload identity is remembered as a site-specific

                    <li>Fixed crash when fontpack.ini specifies a file that cannot

                    <li>Fixed ambiguous font dropdown menu items if some fonts have

                    <li>Added UI translations: Hungarian, Czech.</li>
                    <li>Fixed issues scrolling tall popup menus (e.g., UI language
                        selection).</li>
                    <li>Fixed a line spacing artifact in long headings. With some
                        fonts, the lines were clipping each other so the spacing was

            <description>
                <p>Version 1.6 adds support for bidirectional text and complex scripts,
                    right-to-left paragraph layout, uploads using the Titan protocol,
                    and has an improved mechanism for tracking trust in server

                    a reorganized Preferences and a setting for smooth scrolling
                    speed.</p>
                <p>Changes and fixes in v1.6.5:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Audio init errors are no longer fatal. SDL's error message
                        will still be printed.</li>
                    <li>Fixed appearance of tab buttons (should have 
                        no top frame).</li>

                        to handling of variation selectors (codepoint clusters).

                    <li>Fixed right-clicking on sidebar tab buttons. 
                        It was showing the wrong context menu when the list had been
                        scrolled down.</li>
                    <li>Fixed crash when using the SDL2 KMSDRM video driver.</li>
                    <li>Fixed minor visual artifacts in preformatted blocks and
                        near the bottom of the page.</li>

            <description>
                <p>Bug fixes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crash after updating from v1.2 due to undefined CA file/path
                        configuration.</li>
                    <li>Conflation of pixel ratio and display DPI. Pixel ratio is now
                        always separately detected so mouse events can be correctly
                        positioned. You may find that adjusting the UI scale factor
                        (Preferences &gt; Interface) is necessary after upgrading.</li>
                    <li>Sidebar width changing when moving the window to a different
                        display.</li>

                    <li>Opening Gopher URLs via drag-and-drop.</li>
                    <li>"Add bookmark..." does nothing on a feed entry.</li>
                    <li>Keybindings list not being updated immediately when UI language
                        changes.</li>
                    <li>Trimming of link label text when a custom Emoji is used.</li>
