# Release notes

## 1.17 (6)
* Fixed a few small memory leaks.
* Fixed unnecessary copying of data while waiting for an audio buffer to become playable. This potentially caused the operating system to terminate the app due to excessive memory use.
* Gopher: Detect audio media type from file extension with the `s` item type (it's not always WAV).
* Content that uses `charset=utf-8` is checked for validity. If the encoding is invalid, the content is instead decoded as CP437 (if it has ANSI escapes; possibly it's ASCII art) or just Latin-1.
* Modified rule for when 'text/plain' is assumed to actually be 'text/gemini' based on the file extension.
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.17 (4)
* Tabs opened in background are immediately added to the URL history.
* Fixed initial scope of a created identity when using the default selection.
* Fixed current text selection extending during scrolling even after mouse button has been released.
* Fixed inline image loading indicator overdrawing itself, becoming unreadable.
* ANSI Cursor Forward control sequence ("CSI n C") is converted to a series of spaces, but only in preformatted text.
* Fixed parsing of ANSI SGR sequences with many attributes concatenated (e.g., 0;1;40;30).
* Updated UI translations.

## 1.17 (3)
* Added "Vibrant Light" color theme.
* Improved readability of "Colorful Light" headings.
* Preformatted blocks no longer switch to a smaller font to fit to the page.
* (iPad) Fixed incorrect display scaling when launching the app in Slide Over or Split View mode.
* Fixed horizontal scrolling issues with preformatted blocks: only scroll if needed, allow scrolling anywhere on the block and not just on non-empty text lines, and when scrolling disallow swipe navigation over the area.
* Fixed visual artifacts around and next to preformatted blocks (e.g., streaking).
* Fixed potential crash after (un)folding a preformatted block.
* Fixed links being non-clickable after searching text on a page has scrolled the view. 
* Fixed scroll position being reset when reloading the page.
* Fixed missing page context menu items.

## 1.17 (2)
* Long-press actions on the toolbar: provide access to all the available toolbar actions. Open Settings > Identities by long-pressing on the Identity button.
* Snippets: A collection of short text segments that can be pasted into input prompts and the upload editor. For example, useful for your gemlog header/footer and other often-repeated entries.
* Snippets can be managed in Settings > Snippets and created via the link context menu or by selecting text on a page.
* Custom search queries: Snippets whose name starts with a bang (e.g., "!w") can be invoked in the URL field to make customized queries. The snippet content should be a Gemini search URL, for example: "gemini://gemi.dev/cgi-bin/wp.cgi/search".
* Quick lookup shows matching snippets as a new type of search result.
* Recently submitted input prompt contents are saved persistently and can be restored via the Ellipsis utility menu in the prompt dialog.
* You can force the input prompt to appear before a certain URL is requested so you can enter a query string. This is useful for avoiding an extra request when it is known that a URL will require input (e.g., search engine, game input).
* When importing links as bookmarks, you can optionally create subfolders from headings. You can also choose a destination folder for the imported bookmarks.
* Quickly add/move a bookmark into a folder with the navbar bookmark button context menu (long-press on üè∑Ô∏è).
* User-selectable feed refresh interval. Previously the interval been hardcoded to four hours. (Based on a patch by Michael Nordmeyer.)

* "Fold All" and "Unfold All" in Bookmarks sidebar context menu.
* "Search" context menu item on selected text to make a search query with it.
* "Use as Search URL" in link context menu.
* Menus can have submenus. Several of the old menus were reorganized accordingly. For example, the page context menu has a Tools submenu for translation, Titan uploads, etc.
* "Mark All Links as Visited" in the Tools submenu of the page context menu.
* Support for the Nex protocol (nex://nightfall.city/nex/info/specification.txt).

* Tuned theme color palette and improved background colors of "Colorful Light".

* Adjusted word-wrapping to break at a period inside a word (e.g., domain names).
* If the page is missing a level 1 heading, use the first content line as the title.
