# Release notes

## 1.13 (Beta 6)
* Enabled audio output. WAV and Ogg Vorbis decoding is supported in this build. NOTE: At the moment, playback is not supported when app is in the background, or when the screen is locked. Also, playback may not start if there is already an active player on the page.
* Fixed showing error page for an empty server response.
* Fixes for Spartan: query strings, input prompt default content, empty paths.
* Added Spartan URL handler.

## 1.13 (Beta 5)
New features:
* URL field indicator 🔖 that shows if there's a bookmark for the current page. Clicking on the indicator opens the Add/Edit Bookmark dialog. The indicator is shown in landscape mode.

* Reopening the last closed tab.

Changes and enhancements:
* Updated Noto Emoji font with support for Unicode 14. There should be no more missing Emoji glyphs.

* Colors of the status bar and the device navigation bar change depending on UI/theme colors.
* Adjusted scrolling behavior to be more like regular Android scrolling.
* Changed appearance of many dialogs to use a card layout instead of fullscreen.

## 1.11 (Alpha 6)
⚠️ Downgrading back to v1.10 causes all site-specific themes to be forgotten.

New features:
* Site-specific settings dialog: theme customization and showing ANSI escape warnings. The custom theme is based on a "seed string" chosen by the user.
* Fontpack search. Fonts in the skyjake.fi font library have been indexed based on all the glyphs they provide, so one can look up which fontpacks provide any missing glyphs.
* "Tab width" setting (default: 8). This controls how TAB characters are displayed on pages.
* Setting for maximum valid URI length on 'text/gemini' link lines.
* Option to show images decoded from data URLs immediately after loading a page. This is limited to JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF (no animations).
* TLS session caching: reduces the need for redundant handshaking by keeping old TLS sessions cached for 10 minutes.
* UI language for Italian.

Changes and enhancements:
* The input prompt dialog saves entered text persistently, just like the Upload dialog. This prevents losing text if the dialog is closed accidentally.
* The missing glyphs warning dialog now shows a list of the missing code points.
* Abbreviate font pack descriptions on "about:fonts". The full description is shown when viewing a single fontpack.
* The active tab button uses the theme background color if the page color theme has a bright colorful background to avoid clashing with the UI accent color.
* Adjusted colors of the Gray and Black page themes.
* Added additional (small) variations to theme hues.
* Data URLs have their own link icon.

Fixes:

* TAB characters are no longer forcibly normalized to spaces.
* Pasting LF characters in the URL field should not be possible.

## 1.10 (Alpha 5)
* Fixed cancelling an input query. Now pressing Cancel will navigate back to the previous page as intended.
* Gopher: Fixed navigating to parent. Set item type to 1 to show a gophermap and not the plain source.
* Updated Smol Emoji: added the rest of Unicode 8 Emoji glyphs.

## 1.10 (Alpha 4)
* Save downloads to the external storage so they're accessible from a file manager.
* Handle Gemini, Gopher and Finger URIs opened from other apps.
* Back button dismisses UI panels/dialogs when appropriate instead of navigating back.

## 1.10 (Alpha 3)
* Added Android-specific release notes.
* Added Settings > UI > Toolbar Actions: customize the two leftmost phone toolbar buttons.
* Show build version in Settings > About.
* Changed return key behavior to insert newlines where possible.
* Fixed sizing of the UI when the device has on-screen system keys.
* Fixed the copy/paste menu staying hidden behind the keyboard.
