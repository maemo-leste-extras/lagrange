Usage: lagrange [options] [URLs] [paths]

When multiple URLs and local files are specified, they are opened in
separate tabs.

General options:

  -E, --echo            Print all internal app events to stdout.
  -h, --height N        Set initial window height to N pixels.          
      --help            Print these instructions.
      --sw              Disable hardware accelerated rendering.
  -u, --url-or-search URL | text
                        Open a URL, or make a search query with given text.
                        This only works if the search query URL has been
                        configured.
  -V, --version         Print the application version.
  -w, --width N         Set initial window width to N pixels.

Options that control a running instance of Lagrange:

      --close-tab       Close the current tab.
  -L, --list-tab-urls   Print the URLs of open tabs to stdout. If the app isn't
                        running, nothing is printed.
      --new-tab [URL]   Open a new tab. If the URL is omitted, the user's
                        homepage is opened.                              
      --tab-url         Print the URL of the active tab.
