Usage: lagrange [options] [URLs] [paths]

When multiple URLs and local files are specified, they are opened in
separate tabs.

General options:

  -d, --dump            Print contents of URLs/paths to stdout and quit.
  -I, --dump-identity ARG
                        Use identity ARG with --dump. ARG can be a complete or
                        partial client certificate fingerprint or common name.
  -E, --echo            Print all internal app events to stdout.
      --help            Print these instructions.
      --replace-tab URL Open a URL replacing contents of the active tab.
  -u, --url-or-search URL | text
                        Open a URL, or make a search query with given text.
                        This only works if the search query URL has been
                        configured.
  -U, --user DIR        Set directory where user data files are stored.
  -V, --version         Print the application version.

Options that control a running instance of Lagrange:

      --close-tab       Close the current tab.
  -L, --list-tab-urls   Print the URLs of open tabs to stdout. If the app isn't
                        running, nothing is printed.
      --new-tab [URL]   Open a new tab. If the URL is omitted, the user's
                        homepage is opened.
